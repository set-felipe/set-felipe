# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! I'm a NoSQL Engineer  specialized in **Redis performance**, **high availability**, and **real-time data pipelines**.  
I build tools, dashboards and training content to help developers and teams get the most out of Redis — from monitoring and benchmarking to deep-dive clustering.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 💡 **Redis Specialist** – Cluster setup, replication, memory tuning, monitoring (SLOWLOG, INFO, output buffer)
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Real-time dashboards with **Plotly**, **Dash** and **Python**
- 🧪 **Benchmarking & Load Testing** – Using `redis-benchmark`, `memtier_benchmark`, and latency analysis with percentiles
- 🛠️ **Automation & Containers** – Docker, WSL, and OpenShift environments for distributed Redis deployments
- 🎓 **Educator & Mentor** – I build training content to teach Redis from basics to production-level concepts
